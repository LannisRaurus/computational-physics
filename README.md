# Computational Physics
Here are some tools for my computational physics class.
# Matrix.h
Features to fix - Cofactor matrix isn't working well; generalize sub matrix operation and empty matrix operation; allow for automatic matrix generation (completly full and identity matrix).</br>
Create matrix: `matrix<datatype> name(std::vector<std::vector<datatype>>)`, for example: `matrix<int> test()`
